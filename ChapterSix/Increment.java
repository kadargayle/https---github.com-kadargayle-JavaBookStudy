/**
 * When you invoke a method with an argument, the value of the argument is
 * passed to the parameter.
 * This is referred to as pass-by-value. If the argument is a variable rather
 * than a literal value, the value of the variable is passed to the parameter.
 * The variable is not affected, Â­regardless of the changes made to the
 * parameter inside the method.
 * As given in Listing 6.4, the value of () is passed to the parameter to invoke
 * the method (line 5).
 * The parameter is incremented by in the method (line 10), but is not changed
 * no matter what the method does.
